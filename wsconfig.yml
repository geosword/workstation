# Currently it handles three specific files of plasma, but could also manage tmux, vim or anything else we can resonably control

# Adopt ~/.config/kglobalshortcutsrc to your needs
# Save
# Force kglobalaccel (apparently, responsible for the global shortcuts) to quit and restart: kquitapp kglobalaccel && sleep 2s && kglobalaccel5&
# The above seems to work for me, also without restart. Note that you probably need to replace kquitapp with kquitapp5. So writing the ~/.config files may be a solution

# KDE configuration
# Copy in the config for the task bar to set it up how we want it. We MAY be able to do this with kwriteconfig5, but for now we'll just copy the file in
#
# THIS will get a task switcher setting change noticed, but wont do anything keyboard related.
# We can assign the reloading of kglobalaccel5 to a hotkey, but everything else should need a log out / login if thats whats needed.
